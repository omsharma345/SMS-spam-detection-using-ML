# SMS-spam-detection-using-ML
A machine learning project to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam). Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classification algorithms for accurate text filtering. Built to demonstrate real-world spam detection with data preprocessing and model training
# SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to detect whether a given SMS message is spam or legitimate ("ham"). It applies natural language processing techniques to process text data and trains classifiers to achieve high detection accuracy.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming.
- **Vectorization**: Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer.
- **Model Training**: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), or Logistic Regression models.
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

## Dataset
- SMS Spam Collection Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn
